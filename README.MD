## How to Set Up Your AI Agent

Follow these steps to set up AGENTCODE and start creating your custom AI agents:

### Step 1: Review the README

Start by reading the detailed README on GitHub to understand the setup process and any necessary prerequisites.

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

Clone the AGENTCODE repository to your local machine using the following command:

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install all the necessary dependencies for your project. This can be done using `npm` or `yarn`:

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```

Ensure that the environment is set up properly by verifying that all required packages are installed.

### Step 4: Configure Your Agent

In the `config` directory, you'll find a configuration file, `agent.config.ts`. Open this file and modify the settings to match your needs:

```typescript

userInterface: {
    interfaceType: 'Web',
    logLevel: 'error',
  },

  workflowAutomation: {
    autoActions: [
      {
        trigger: 'dataLoad',
        action: 'optimizeData',
      },
    ],
    automationEnabled: true,
  },

  workflowAutomationStep1: {
    autoActions: [
      {
        trigger: 'dataUpdate',
        action: 'optimizeDatabase',
      },
    ],
    automationEnabled: true,
  },

  workflowAutomationStep2: {
    autoActions: [
      {
        trigger: 'dataUpgrade',
        action: 'upgradeDatabase',
      },
    ],
    automationEnabled: true,
  },

export const agentConfig = {
  agentName: 'SupportAgent',
  taskTypes: ['workflowAutomation', 'problemSolving', 'dataAnalysis'],
  parallelProcessing: false,
  learningEnabled: false,

  errorHandling: {
    logErrors: true,
    retryOnFailure: 5,
  },
};
```

### Step 5: Start the AI Agent

Once everything is set up, you can start the AI agent using the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

Or, if you're using `yarn`:

```bash
yarn start
```

This will launch the agent and make it ready to execute tasks based on the configuration provided.

### Step 6: Test Locally

Test your agent locally to verify its functionality. Below is an example of how you might test it:

```typescript
import { AGENTCODE } from 'AGENTCODE';

const agent = new AGENTCODE(agentConfig);

const hosted_agents = agent.addAllAgents(
  ['agent1': [setup; database; loads]], 
  ['agent2': [setup; database; loads]]
  ['agent3': [setup; database; loads]]
  ['agent4': [setup; database; loads]]
  ['agent5': [setup; database; loads]]
  ...
)

const agents = agent.executeTask('workflowAutomation', {
  taskDetails: 'Automate the email filtering process based on priority levels',
  hosted_agents,
  platforms
});

agents.workflow_preprocess();
agents.workflow_process();
const result = agents.up();

console.log(result);
```

The agent should execute the task and output the result in the console, confirming that the agent is working as expected.
