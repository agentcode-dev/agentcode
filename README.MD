# AgentNode: Feature of AI Agents management

AgentNode is a cutting-edge workflow platform designed exclusively for Web3 to create, manage, and control AI agents with seamless integration of various Web3 services.

With its robust framework, AgentNode empowers users to build sophisticated AI agents while leveraging the decentralized ecosystem. The platform supports modular integrations, enabling effortless connectivity to a wide range of Web3 tools, protocols, and services.

## Features

1. **AI Workflow Management**  
   Streamline the creation and oversight of AI agents with an intuitive workflow system.

2. **Web3 Integration:**  
   Seamlessly incorporate Web3 protocols, smart contracts, and decentralized tools.

3. **Scalability**  
   Designed to adapt to diverse use cases, from automation to advanced decision-making tasks

4. **Continuous Learning**  
   At the core of AgentNodeâ€™s functionality is the ability of agents to learn and improve over time. As the agents interact with their environment and process more data, they gather insights and adapt their actions accordingly. This continuous learning process makes agents smarter, more efficient, and more accurate at performing their tasks.

10. **User-Friendly Interface**  
   Despite its powerful capabilities, AgentNode offers an intuitive interface for both developers and users. It provides a straightforward way to configure agents, set up workflows, and manage interactions. Whether you're a technical user setting up an agent from scratch or a business user leveraging pre-built agents, AgentNode's design simplifies the experience.

## Example Use Cases for AgentNode

- **Customer Support Automation**: AgentNode can be used to create AI agents that provide automated customer support. These agents can answer common questions, route customer inquiries to the right department, and even troubleshoot issues, reducing the need for human intervention.
  
- **Business Process Automation**: AgentNode can automate repetitive tasks such as data entry, report generation, and email handling, increasing operational efficiency and freeing up employees to focus on more strategic work.

- **Personal Assistants**: AgentNode allows the creation of virtual assistants that can handle day-to-day tasks, from setting reminders to managing schedules, emails, and contacts, offering enhanced productivity for users.

- **Data Analysis and Reporting**: With AgentNode, you can create agents that automatically analyze large datasets and generate insightful reports, helping businesses make data-driven decisions quickly and efficiently.

- **Dynamic Decision-Making Systems**: AgentNode AI agents are capable of handling complex decision-making tasks, such as evaluating business performance, detecting anomalies in data, and recommending improvements in operational strategies.

## How to Set Up Your AI Agent

Follow these steps to set up AgentNode and start creating your custom AI agents:

### Step 1: Review the README

Start by reading the detailed README on GitHub to understand the setup process and any necessary prerequisites.

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

Clone the AgentNode repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agentnode-dev/AgentNode/agentNode.git
cd agentNode
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install all the necessary dependencies for your project. This can be done using `npm` or `yarn`:

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```

Ensure that the environment is set up properly by verifying that all required packages are installed.

### Step 4: Configure Your Agent

In the `config` directory, you'll find a configuration file, `agent.config.ts`. Open this file and modify the settings to match your needs:

```typescript

userInterface: {
    interfaceType: 'Web',
    logLevel: 'error',
  },

  workflowAutomation: {
    autoActions: [
      {
        trigger: 'dataLoad',
        action: 'optimizeData',
      },
    ],
    automationEnabled: true,
  },

  workflowAutomationStep1: {
    autoActions: [
      {
        trigger: 'dataUpdate',
        action: 'optimizeDatabase',
      },
    ],
    automationEnabled: true,
  },

  workflowAutomationStep2: {
    autoActions: [
      {
        trigger: 'dataUpgrade',
        action: 'upgradeDatabase',
      },
    ],
    automationEnabled: true,
  },

export const agentConfig = {
  agentName: 'SupportAgent',
  taskTypes: ['workflowAutomation', 'problemSolving', 'dataAnalysis'],
  parallelProcessing: false,
  learningEnabled: false,

  errorHandling: {
    logErrors: true,
    retryOnFailure: 5,
  },
};
```

### Step 5: Start the AI Agent

Once everything is set up, you can start the AI agent using the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

Or, if you're using `yarn`:

```bash
yarn start
```

This will launch the agent and make it ready to execute tasks based on the configuration provided.

### Step 6: Test Locally

Test your agent locally to verify its functionality. Below is an example of how you might test it:

```typescript
import { AgentNode } from 'agentnode'; // assuming the module is available

const agent = new AgentNode(agentConfig);

const hosted_agents = agent.addAllAgents(
  ['agent1': [setup; database; loads]], 
  ['agent2': [setup; database; loads]]
  ['agent3': [setup; database; loads]]
  ['agent4': [setup; database; loads]]
  ['agent5': [setup; database; loads]]
  ...
)

const agents = agent.executeTask('workflowAutomation', {
  taskDetails: 'Automate the email filtering process based on priority levels',
  hosted_agents,
  platforms
});

agents.workflow_preprocess();
agents.workflow_process();
const result = agents.up();

console.log(result);
```

The agent should execute the task and output the result in the console, confirming that the agent is working as expected.
